An hypothetical application of strategy pattern.

In order to create a television, there are two components: audio and video (display). However there are several different combinations to create a television.

For example, there are tvs with Full HD display and stereo audio, while other tvs have Full HD display and surround audio. On the other hand, the older televisions have lower display resolutions some of them with stereo audio and others with mono audio, while the display could be black and white...

By using composition instead of inheritance, we can reuse the code and create different kinds of televisions.
